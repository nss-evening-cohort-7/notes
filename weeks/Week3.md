## Inheritance :family_man_woman_girl_boy:

Everyone remember [prototypal inheritance](https://stevebrownlee.keybase.pub/OLOO/assets/player/KeynoteDHTMLPlayer.html#0)?
If so, [the relationships in C#](https://github.com/nss-evening-cohort-06/bangazon-inc/blob/master/orientation/09_RELATIONSHIPS.md) look and act different, but can feel familiar.

If not, it might be a good idea to review [JavaScript inheritance](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Inheritance_and_the_prototype_chain).
These [first 4 articles](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/Basics) look helpful and in depth.
