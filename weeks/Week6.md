Up to now we've been representing the things in our applications with Classes such as `User`, `Vehicle`, `Candy`, etc. Outside of code, these things are called models, or entities.

[Normalization](https://www.essentialsql.com/get-ready-to-learn-sql-database-normalization-explained-in-simple-english/) is the process of separating your data entities into the smallest logical groups.

You'll represent the relationships between your different entities with [Crows foot notation](http://www.vertabelo.com/blog/technical-articles/crow-s-foot-notation)

### SQL Syntax
- You'll be learning [_T-SQL_](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/language-reference) syntax.
	> _Microsoft SQL Server_ runs in the background, locally on your computer. The program you use to interact with the SQL Server instance is _SQL Server Management Studio_ (SSMS).

	> There are many different implementations of SQL, but they are all fairly similar because SQL is merely a documented standard (explain ECMA(JavaScript) -> V8,SpiderMonkey,Chakra relationship? It's kinda everywhere.).
